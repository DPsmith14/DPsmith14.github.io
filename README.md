# cubitos-probability-calculator

This is a work in progress for calculating the probability of not busting in the board game Cubitos. The math might be wrong, and if you find something wrong with it let me know!

wanted to do for fun. If John D. Clair, or AEG wants me to close this website I will glady do. (this was the best legal sounding thing I could say)
